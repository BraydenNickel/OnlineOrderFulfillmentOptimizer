# Project Description
This program is designed to help optimize the workflow of online order systems.

# Programming Language and Justification
The program was coded using the C# language. It was decided to use C# for its scalability, ability with outside databases, its wide use in logistics, and its compatibility with the scope of the project. Because of the way it handles compiling and runtime, it can easily catch common errors like missing values or an incorrect data type. It can easily integrate existing databases of logistics companies for easy transfer of data. It bas built in integration and a detailed documentation regarding parallelization and its Error-Handling systems are easy to use and navigate. C# is also widely used by logistics companies for inventory management and order fulfillment.
